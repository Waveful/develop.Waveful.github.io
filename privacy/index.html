    Hi 👋<br>
    I'm Waveful, the creator-friendly social network where everyone can become a creator 🌊
    <br><br>
    Before diving in a more formal explanation of our privacy policy, let me briefly tell you my mission 🚀<br>
    My goal is to be a social network where everyone can share their passions and feel welcomed in a comfortable and positive environment; where creators can thrive and where users can enjoy original content, find new meaningful connections and have fun.
    I hope I'm doing well in this, but you be the judge!
    <br><br>
    I collect data using the latest industry security standards, and the collected data is used with the only goal of delivering the best experience a social network can offer 📡<br>
    Waveful does not sell your data and will never do.
    In fact, to be sustainable, Waveful has some paid elements in the platform (purchasable likes and premium subscriptions).
    I know some users don't like to pay for a service, but the core functionalities of Waveful are free and will always remain free, and you can still enjoy the Waveful experience without spending a single cent!
    <br><br>
    Now I'll leave you to a more formal explanation of our data collection practices, and thanks for being here!

        <h2 id="how-it-is-shared">How it is Shared</h2>

        Much of the information on the Service is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account.
        By using the Service, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.
        When you submit content to a public part of the Service, any visitors to and users of our Service will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content.
        Although some parts of the Service may be private or quarantined, they may become public and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Service.
        <br><br>
        Your Waveful account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Service, such as your username and prior posts.
        <br><br>
        We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Service with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features.
        <br><br>
        Waveful only shares nonpublic information about you in the following ways. We do not sell this information.

        <h2 id="how-we-protect-your-information">How We Protect Your Information</h2>

        We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
        For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted and only public information is available by means other than the official Waveful app verified by authentication.
        <br><br>
        Security of your account is granted by the use of non-password login methods, which rely their security on other authentication methods such as Google and Apple authentication. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication for your Google account, your Apple account, or your email provider, or by ensuring you are the only one to have access to your phone number.
        <br><br>
        We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.
